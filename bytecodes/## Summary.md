## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
- **What is LIFO and FIFO?**
	- LIFO stands for Last In First Out, used to describe how a stack operates. FIFO stands for First In First Out, used to describe queue operations.
- **How can stacks and queues be used in programming?**
	- They are used to manage data in a way that might be needed quickly, in an ordered manner, such as managing function calls (stack) or printing tasks (queue).
- **Are there any real-world applications of these data structures?**
	- Yes, stacks are used in undo mechanisms in software, while queues are used in scheduling tasks in operating systems.
- **Can these concepts be visualized easily?**
	- Yes, the video provides visual examples that simplify understanding these concepts.
- **Where can I learn more about implementing these data structures?**
	- Further learning can be pursued through coding tutorials online or computer science courses focusing on data structures.
